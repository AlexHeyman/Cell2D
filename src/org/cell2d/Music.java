/**
 * <p>A Music track is a piece of music that can be played in the background of
 * a CellGame. All playing and stopping of Music tracks is controlled by methods
 * of a CellGame, so that the CellGame can keep track of the Music tracks in its
 * music stack.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Like other Loadables, Music tracks can be manually loaded and unloaded
 * into and out of memory. Loading may take a moment, but while a Music track is
 * not loaded, it cannot play.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Music tracks can be played at different speeds from 0 up, with a speed of
 * 0 pausing the Music track and a speed of 1 causing no speed change. They can
 * also be played at different volumes between 0 and 1, with a volume of 0
 * making the Music track inaudible and a volume of 1 causing no volume change.
 * Finally, the Music class has a global volume between 0 and 1, by which the
 * effective volumes of all currently playing Music tracks are scaled. The
 * global volume is 1 by default.</p>
